I was browsing the [/r/muse][/r/muse] subreddit and came across a fun Muse ['30 Day Song Challenge'][challenge op]. It reminded me of back in the day when you would answer loads of questions and then forward it on or tag friends.

Anyway I thought it would be fun! I'm impatient and just did the lot in one go!
