excerpt: If I had may way this is the setlist which would make my night!

_Note: This setlist is subject to change. Muse, if you're reading.. I am open to suggestions._

I have seen Muse live countless times and thoroughly enjoy it every time but given the chance; this is the setlist I would choose. You can browse below or go stright to the [playlist][setlist]

Let's set the scene. The lights go off. It's pitch black. Silence. Then the first song starts, lasers sweep up from the floor to a foot above the crowd.

- [MK Ultra][MK Ultra]: _I have been lucky enough to see this live at Wembley. A great way to kick off my setlist!_
- [Take A Bow][Take A Bow]
- [Map Of The Problematique][Map Of The Problematique]
- [Animals][Animals]: _Wasn't a fan of this until I saw it live._
- [Liquid State][Liquid State]: _Possibly a marmite song but it was great live._
- [Helsinki Jam][Helsinki Jam]
- [Dead Star][Dead Star]: _Saw this in the pissing down rain in the middle of a park with the laser cutting through the rain. Awesome experience._
- [Glorious][Glorious]: _An awesome B-Side that has only been performed live 10 times._
- [Follow Me][Follow Me]
- [Starlight][Starlight]
- [The Handler][The Handler]: _At the time of writing I am yet to see this live but know it will be amazing._
- [Thoughts of a Dying Atheist][Thoughts of a Dying Atheist]

**They leave... _that can't be it?!_**

- [Resistance][Resistance]
- [The Small Print][The Small Print]
- [Showbiz][Showbiz]
- [The Globalist][The Globalist]

**And the encore...**

- [The 2nd Law: Isolated System][The 2nd Law: Isolated System]: _During the interlude with the music video. Love it!_
- [In Your World][In Your World]: _As the previous song is fading out, this slowly fades in._
- [Stockholm Syndrome][Stockholm Syndrome]
- [Bliss][Bliss]

## WHAT! NO KoC?!

This has to be address as I think the majority of people would have it as their finale. I feel like it has become a bit clich√© that the setlist ends on Knights of Cydonia and everyone has a good old fashioned mosh. I love the song but would like to see a different end to the show if I had my way.

## What would you change?
It's tough because there isn't a song I dislike so choosing the ones I would want at a gig is what I have gone for. 

This is mine; what would you have instead? 

Don't forget, you can listen to my setlist on my [Youtube][setlist] playlist.
