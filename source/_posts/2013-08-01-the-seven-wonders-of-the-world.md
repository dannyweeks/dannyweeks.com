Ever since I was a child I have been obsessed with the Wonders of the World. There is a lot of confusion around what the wonders of the world are. Have no fear, I will clear them up in a jiffy! The original wonders of the world are often referred to as the ‘Ancient Wonders of the World’ and are as follows:

- The Colossus of Rhodes
- The Great Pyramid of Giza
- The Hanging Gardens of Babylon
- The Lighthouse of Alexandria
- The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus

The ancient wonders of the world I think are just amazing feats of engineering and construction for the period they where built. Having said that, only one out of the seven still exist today, the rest have been destroyed over the years. Fun fact, the oldest wonder is the last one standing (being the Great Pyramid of Giza). There are many variations of the ambiguous ‘Seven Wonders of the World’. Some are variations of the above with some switched out for things like the Great Wall of China.

You name it, there is a 7 Wonders for it, Modern World, Underwater World, Industrial World and wonders for every country on the planet they all have it. One list out there which is quite interesting to me in a geeky way is the 7 Wonders Of The Solar System:

- Enceladus
- The Great red spot
- The Asteroid belt
- The surface of the Sun
- The Oceans of Earth
- The Rings of Saturn
- Olympus Mons (My personal favourite)

Side note: Olympus Mons being the tallest mountain on any planet in the Solar System, put it next to Mt. Everest and you see how truly impressive this is. [Here][comparison] is a comparison for you!

As someone who has a love for exploring the world some of these lists are impossible to be a bucket list, either the place doesn’t exist anymore or there is a better chance becoming a billionaire than seeing the wonder with your own eyes. So I now present to you..
