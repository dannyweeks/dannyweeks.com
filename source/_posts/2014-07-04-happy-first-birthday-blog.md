## Failures and Successes

There have been some failures posted on this blog – such as random facts. Although they are interesting they are not what I want this to be they are too small to mean anything. Another I consider to be a failure is my categories apart from “My Thoughts” the other categories just don't get enough love put into them but I hope to increase the lovin’ this year.

Below are what I consider my successes.

## Knowing about uncontacted tribes facinates me

First up is actually my first real blog I posted. I had a lot of ideas about this one since I had been thinking about creating a blog for a while and this was the result. [Knowing about uncontacted tribes fascinates me][uncontacted] and still does to this day. The thought that they have no idea what the rest of the world is like just blows my mind.

## The ‘Seven Wonders Of The World’

The [‘Seven Wonders Of The World’][wonders] is an ambiguous term that has many interpretations and assumptions. From a young age I have been interested in the Seven Wonders of the World; in this blog I explore what they are, what people think they are and the fact there are hundreds of them!

## How will we be remembered?

After reading about a NASA space program it sparked the question [“How will we be remembered?“][how]. As a race, it’s questionable how we will be remembered.. most likely by the nuclear wasteland we once called Earth but also how will, as individuals, will we be remembered?

## How will it all end?

Honestly, this is the post I am most proud of. My blogs usually consist of multiple facts I have learned and made a note of which all cause me to be inspired to write a blog on a specific subject or idea. This is a prime example of when I have been really interested in a subject. [How will it all end?][end] you will have to read it to find out.

## Plan for the Future

One thing is for sure, over the past year the majority of my blogs have become more refined and I can certainly pinpoint the style of blog I enjoy writing the most. As I mentioned in my blog [Be The One Percent][one] I enjoy philosophical type blogs. I feel these are where I personally think my writing style excels but also the ones I enjoy writing the most.

My goals for the next year are:

- Have more interactions with my blog such as comments
- Focus more on advertising the blog using social media and SEO
- Increase the number of philosophical posts since I enjoy them the most and they should attract the most discussion
- Be more consistent with frequency of posts

The goals listed above kind of go hand in hand – advertising more would hopefully gain more interactions with posts, having more to advertise should hopefully give more odds of having a successful post.

If you have got this far down – thank you. I ask you one thing, please give me your thoughts in the comments and share it with anyone you think may enjoy it.
