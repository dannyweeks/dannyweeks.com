            <h2>Programmer</h2>
            <p>
                Programming is my hobby and luckily also my job. By trade I am a PHP developer and have used Wordpress and Codeigniter in the past. I am quite passionate about Laravel and really enjoy using it and have attended Laracon EU in the past. When it comes to the front end nothing pleases me more than tidy html and organised CSS (using SCS) and Javascript. Being a web developer I have to be 100% confident with the front end even though backend is what I enjoy the most.

            <p>
                Along with the random my blog posts I do, I also write about <a href="/blog/categories/web-dev/">Web Development</a> related topics ranging from general topics such as <a href="/blog/2016/01/15/using-sculpin/">how I build this site</a> to more specific things like "<a href="/blog/2015/06/20/handling-errors-in-laravel-5-1/">Handling Errors In Laravel</a>".

                I am always looking to <a href="{{ site.github }}">contribute</a> to open source projects and have a <a href="/projects">few of my own</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have dabbled in other languages such as Python, Elixir and Rust but nothing I could confidently shout about!

            <p>
                I have been a gamer since I was very young but as my love for programming has grown gaming has slowly taken a back seat.

            <p>
                I now usually only play at the weekends playing competitive games such as League Of Legends, Counter Strike, and Starcraft. If I'm not playing competitively I enjoy single player puzzle games such as

                I am part of a tight community of friends who play online together, we also meet up at <a href="/blog/2015/12/21/the-truth-about-lan-insomnia-56/">LAN events</a> throughout the year.

                I don't claim to be the greatest photographer in the world but I do like it when a photo turns out nice!

                I enjoy taking photos of landscapes and animals. <a href="/blog/2015/03/20/solar-eclipse-2015/">Astrophotography</a> comes as part of the package with my love for stargazing &amp; astronomy.
